# Instructions

There is a `install.sh` file in this directory, which installs `nasm`, which can compile assembly.

You can **only run this script on linux/debian** systems, or **WSL (Window Subsystem for Linux)** on Windows.

To run the script:
- Navigate to the directory with `install.sh` in it
- Enable execute permissions on the file with `chmod +x install.sh`
- Run the file with `./install.sh`
