<br>
Hackers don't just wear hoodies! It's time we moved beyond the ideas of scary super-hackers and acknowledge that the skills and knowledge needed to compromise computer systems are more common than many think. In this session attendees will see real demonstrations of common attacks giving them a more grounded idea of what 'hacking' really means, from Australiaâ€™s top-ranked competitive hacking team, Emu Exploit. As organisations put increasing resources into protecting themselves from the commonly sensationalised threat of cyber-attack, it is vital that decision-makers are given opportunities to learn from hackers what that label really means.
